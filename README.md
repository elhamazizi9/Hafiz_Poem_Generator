# Hafiz_Poem_Generator
Natural Language Processing has shown to be very practical in many applications. Text generation is one that can transform data into text.
The process of text generation in future will be so useful in many areas including contend generation for websites, publishing book or inspiration for writing new ideas, or maybe taking exams…!!!

In favor of NLP and RNN networks I have been able to produce Hafiz poems which were not too bad.

A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a class of artificial neural networks where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence. This allows it to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior. Derived from feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use their internal state (memory) to process variable length sequences of inputs. This makes them applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition or speech recognition.
